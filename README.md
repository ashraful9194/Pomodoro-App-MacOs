### Pomodoro Productivity Tracker

I built this **Pomodoro Productivity Tracker** to help me stay focused and understand my own work habits. It's a modern, SwiftUI-based timer that not only helps you stick to the classic Pomodoro Technique but also lets you track and visualize your productivity across different categories. I've found it incredibly useful for my own workflow, and I hope it helps you too\!

### âœ¨ What It Does

I wanted a tool that went beyond just a simple timer, so I added a few key features that I personally found valuable:

  * **Classic Pomodoro Timer**: It cycles through work sessions, short breaks, and long breaks to keep you on track.
  * **Customizable Durations**: I often need different focus times, so you can choose from presets (15, 25, 45, 60 minutes) or set your own custom duration.
  * **Categorization**: I like to see where my time goes, so I added the ability to tag each session with a category like "Work," "Study," or "Reading." You can add new ones as you go.
  * **Visualizations**: Seeing my progress keeps me motivated. The app includes:
      * A **Daily Timeline** to see what you accomplished throughout the day.
      * **Streak & Goal Tracking** to help you build consistent habits.
      * **In-Depth Statistics** with a **Bar Chart**, **Heatmap**, and **Time of Day Analysis** to find out when you're most productive.
      * You can filter all these charts by category to get specific insights.
  * **"Always on Top" for macOS**: As a macOS user, I found it helpful to keep the timer visible while working, so I added a "Keep on Top" feature to pin the window.
  * **Sound Notifications**: Simple audible feedback to let you know when it's time to switch tasks.
